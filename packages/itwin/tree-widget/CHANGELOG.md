## 3.6.0

Fri, 21 Mar 2025 11:37:20 GMT

### Minor changes

- Add ability to remove root Subject node from Models and iModel content trees by setting `hideRootSubject: true` in the `hierarchyConfig` prop. ([#1251](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1251))

### Patches

- Fixed Models tree showing that modeled elements have children, when their sub model is private or when sub model does not have any elements. Now it shows that modeled element has children only when it's sub model has children and is not private. ([#1253](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1253))
- Fixed Categories tree showing definition containers that contain categories without elements. Now it displays definition containers only when they have categories that contain elements. ([#1248](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1248))

## 3.5.1

Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:37:44 GMT

### Patches

- Update import to use `@itwin/core-bentley` for types that are reexported by `@itwin/core-common` ([#1232](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1232))

## 3.5.0

Wed, 19 Feb 2025 21:08:10 GMT

### Minor changes

- `CategoriesTree` component rendered `Categories` as a flat list, where each `Category` had zero or more child `SubCategories`. Some iTwin.js applications started to group `Categories` under `DefinitionContainers` and wanted to see them displayed in `CategoriesTree` component. Added `DefinitionContainers` to `CategoriesTree` component. This change doesn't affect applications that don't have `DefinitionContainers`. ([#1172](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1172))

## 3.4.2

Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:54:49 GMT

### Patches

- Adjusted modeled element / sub-model visibility controls. Now, if visibility of modeled element is changed, visibility of sub-model is adjusted accordingly and vice versa. ([#1183](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1183))

## 3.4.1

Thu, 06 Feb 2025 13:36:20 GMT

### Patches

- Removed horizontal scroll from trees. ([#1180](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1180))

## 3.4.0

Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:29:52 GMT

### Minor changes

- Expose `FocusedInstancesContextProvider` and `useFocusedInstancesContext` to allow using `ModelsTreeComponent.ToggleInstancesFocusButton` from outside of `ModelsTreeComponent` and accesing the context from other React components. ([#1175](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1175))
- Add `filterButtonsVisibility` prop to `TreeRenderer`. The prop allows to control visibility of hierarchy level filtering buttons in the tree: `show-on-hover` (default) shows them on hover or focus, `hide` only shows them when a node is filtered. ([#1178](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1178))

## 3.3.0

Mon, 27 Jan 2025 18:30:40 GMT

### Minor changes

- Define `type` and `exports` attributes in `package.json`. The `exports attribute prohibits access to APIs that are not intended to be used by external consumers. The `type: "module"` attribute addition moves this package a step closer towards dropping CommonJS support - it's now transpiled from ESM to CommonJS instead of the opposite. ([#1147](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1147))
- Add support for AppUI 5.x ([#1147](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1147))

### Patches

- Fix visibility button with no content rendering empty tooltip. ([#1145](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1145))

## 3.2.4

Tue, 14 Jan 2025 02:51:04 GMT

### Patches

- Fixed a bug in `CategoriesTreeDefinition.createInstanceKeyPaths`, where sometimes incorrect key paths would be created. Because of this, `CategoriesTree` would show incorrect categories with applied label filter. ([#1139](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1139))

## 3.2.3

Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:28:10 GMT

### Patches

- Changed `onHierarchyLoad` to log errors to console ([#1135](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1135))

## 3.2.2

Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:30:55 GMT

### Patches

## 3.2.1

Tue, 07 Jan 2025 12:53:32 GMT

### Patches

- Increase performance consistency when creating filtering paths from target items. ([#1130](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1130))
- Reduced main thread blockage ~3 times when creating filtering paths from target items. ([#1123](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1123))

## 3.2.0

Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:42:56 GMT

### Minor changes

- Added an optional `selectionPredicate` function prop to `ModelsTreeComponent`, `ModelsTree`, `useModelsTree` and `Tree` components. When provided, it allows consumers to conditionally enable/disable selection of tree nodes. ([#1124](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1124))

### Patches

- Bump dependencies ([#1122](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1122))

## 3.1.0

Fri, 29 Nov 2024 10:43:06 GMT

### Minor changes

- Replaced `ModelsTreeVisibilityHandlerOverrides.changeElementState` with `ModelsTreeVisibilityHandlerOverrides.changeElementsState`. The method is provided with a list of elements instead of single element to allow changing visibility of multiple elements in single batch istead of one by one. ([#1098](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1098))

### Patches

- Bump dependencies ([#1103](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1103))
- Add missing tooltips ([#1092](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1092))
- Reduce the number of queries being executed when always/never drawn sets change. ([#1102](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1102))
- Improve performance of visibility status calculation and visibility changes. Also reduce main thread blocking to avoid UI freezing. ([#1098](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1098))

## 3.0.3

Fri, 15 Nov 2024 15:03:19 GMT

### Patches

## 3.0.2

Tue, 12 Nov 2024 12:57:13 GMT

### Patches

- Update ECSQL queries to always use `.Id` suffix when querying navigation properties - that substantially improves query performance. ([#1085](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1085))
- Models tree: Improved performance of creating instance key paths for large numbers of target instances by up to 200x. ([#1084](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1084))
- Updated `TreeNodeRenderer` to pass `ref` to the underlying `TreeNodeRenderer` from `@itwin/presentation-hierarchies-react`. ([#1078](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1078))

## 3.0.1

Tue, 15 Oct 2024 20:19:11 GMT

### Patches

- Bump `presentation` package dependencies for bug fixes and orders of magnitude hierarchy filtering performance improvement. ([#1067](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/1067))

## 3.0.0

Fri, 04 Oct 2024 15:06:44 GMT

### Major changes

- The `3.0` release affects nearly all components in this package, usually in a breaking way. As a result, we suggest treating this version as a completely new package rather than an incremental upgrade - please have a look at the [README](./README.md) for a list of new features and examples on how to consume the new version ([#966](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/pull/966))
