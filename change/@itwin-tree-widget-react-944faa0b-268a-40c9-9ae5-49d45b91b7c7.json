  "comment": "`CategoriesTree` component rendered `Categories` as a flat list, where each `Category` had zero or more child `SubCategories`. Some iTwin.js applications started to group `Categories` under `DefinitionContainers` and wanted to see them displayed in `CategoriesTree` component. Added `DefinitionContainers` to `CategoriesTree` component. This change doesn't affect applications that don't have `DefinitionContainers`.",
