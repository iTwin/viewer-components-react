  // grid. This is done to improve scrolling performance (https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/issues/47), but
  // causes some blurriness in the rendered text, which causes flakiness in our e2e tests. Reset the style to avoid that.
  // We may want to consider removing the style altogether through the virtualized property grid component in case
  // anyone complains about the blurriness.
