Copyright Â© Bentley Systems, Incorporated. All rights reserved.

The tree-widget-react package provides React components to access Models and Categories within an iModel via a UiProvider, `TreeWidgetUiItemsProvider`.

The package also provides the underlying component, `TreeWidgetComponent`, which you can wrap within your own custom UiProvider and pass in your own custom trees to display.

## Usage

### What to add in your iTwin AppUI based application

With a few short lines, you can add the tree widget to your app.

#### Call TreeWidget.initialize() **_before_** making use of the provided Tree Widget Provider

```ts
import { TreeWidget } from "@itwin/tree-widget-react";
...
await TreeWidget.initialize(IModelApp.localization);
```

#### Register Tree Widget Provider

```ts
import { UiItemsManager } from "@itwin/appui-abstract";
import { TreeWidgetUiItemsProvider } from "@itwin/tree-widget-react";
...
UiItemsManager.register(
  new TreeWidgetUiItemsProvider({ ...TreeWidgetOptions })
);
```

### Additional trees avaialable

#### IModelContentTree

Component that displays a hierarchy with content of a given `IModelConnection`.

##### Resulting hierarchy

- Root Subject
  - Child Subjects
    - Target Model
      - Spatial Categories of top-assemblies in the Model (if model is a GeometricModel3d)
        - Top-assemblies in the model and category
          - Child elements of the assembly
      - Drawing Categories of top-assemblies in the Model (if model is a GeometricModel2d)
        - Top-assemblies in the model and category
          - Child elements of the assembly
      - Top-assemblies in the Model (if model is neither GeometricModel3d nor GeometricModel2d)
        - Child elements of the assembly

In addition, for every modeled element we show content of the model as children for the element's node.
