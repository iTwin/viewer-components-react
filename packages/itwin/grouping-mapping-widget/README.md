The Grouping Mapping widget is a UI component for iTwin Viewer applications that simplifies how users (and developers) interface with the [Reporting Platform APIs](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/insights/overview/).
The grouping-mapping-widget package provides a UiProvider class - `GroupingMappingProvider` - which can be passed into the `uiProviders` prop of the iTwin Viewer's `<Viewer />` component.

## Getting Started

This is not a standalone UI and requires a parent iTwin Viewer application to work as intended.
A guide on how to create a basic iTwin Viewer application can be found here: <https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/tutorials/develop-web-viewer/>.
This package provides a viewer 'widget'. Documentation on how to add a widget to your application can be found here: <https://developer.bentley.com/tutorials/itwin-viewer-hello-world/#2-your-first-ui-widget>.

## Permissions and Scopes

The SPA client used by your iTwin viewer must have these additional scopes:

- `insights:read`
- `insights:modify`
- `projects:read`

In addition, users must have the `imodels_read` and `imodels_write` [permissions](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/insights/operations/create-mapping/#authorization) assigned at either the Project or iModel level. Further instruction on how to create roles and assign permissions can be found in the [iTwin Platform Projects API documentation](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/projects/tutorials/).

## Sample usage

```tsx
import { GroupingMappingProvider } from "@itwin/grouping-mapping-widget";
<Viewer
  ...
  uiProviders={[new GroupingMappingProvider()]}
/>
```

## UI Configuration

This package provides an interface to define your own group creation method. You can use your own UI component to create or update the query.

An example of group custom UI provider, [ManualGroupingUI](https://github.com/iTwin/viewer-components-react/blob/master/packages/itwin/grouping-mapping-widget/src/widget/components/provider/ManualGroupingUI.tsx) helps user to manually define ECSQL query for groups.

In CustomUIComponentProps:

- `updateQuery` is used to run the query and visualize results in the viewer.
- `isUpdating` keeps track of the status of query execution.
- `resetView` enables you to reset the viewer state.

To configure your own UI provider, you need to give it:

- a `name` as identifier
- a `displayLabel` which will show in the 'Add Group' dropdown list
- a `uiComponent` like above
- an optional `icon`

You can define your UI provider as follows in the GroupingMappingProvider:

```tsx
new GroupingMappingProvider({
  customUIs: [
    {
      name: "Manual",
      displayLabel: "Manual Query",
      uiComponent: ManualGroupingUI,
      icon: <SvgDraw />,
    },
  ],
});
```
