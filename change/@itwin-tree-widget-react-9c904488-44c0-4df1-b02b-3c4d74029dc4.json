  "comment": "Added `SharedTreeContextProvider` that should be used to wrap the tree components and hooks. This allows the trees to share internal state and reduce the number of performed queries, thus improving overall performance. The `TreeWidgetComponent` adds the context automatically, so adding it is only needed when rendering lower level components.",
